        The current sant satguru of Ra-Dha-Sva-Aa-Mi faith is Prof. Prem Saran Satsangi (Param guru huzur satsangi sahab). He was born on 9th march 1937 in a Hindu family of Banaras.
        -> Professor P.S. Satsangi obtained his B.Sc(Engg) from the Banaras Hindu Univesity in 1957, M.S. from Michigan State University in 1961, and Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo in 1969, all in Electrical Engineering. His Ph.D. dissertation was entitled "A Physical System Theory Modelling Framework Generalized for Large Scale Economic Systems."
        -> In 1964, Professor Satsangi joined the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi where He served for 28 years, pursuing a stellar academic and research career while discharging a wide spectrum of administrative responsibilities. He carried out applied systems research, developing the requisite theoretical framework and then undertaking a major, real-world application of it, mostly in an Indian context. His research in energy and transport systems was seminal and influenced public policy implementation in this country. He had a prodigious research output, with about 250 research papers and 35 PhDs in diverse fields. One of the doyens of the international Systems movement, He was the Founder-President of the Systems Society of India and the founder and first Chief Editor of its journal, Paritantra.
        -> Professor Satsangi took voluntary retirement from IIT Delhi in May 1993 to assume the post of to assume the post of Honorary Director of the  DEI, where He served until March 2002. During this period he propelled the rapid growth of the Institute, and although He was involved primarily in academic administration, He continued to participate in systems research and practice.

A novel approach to sustainability and the practice of "better worldliness" with utmost economy was articulated in His Sigma 6QVA Model, based on the linear and nonlinear interaction of 6 key qualities values and attributes.
        -> Through His unique position as both a Systems Scientist and Spiritual leader of Dayalbagh, Professor Satsangi has extended the application of physical systems theory to new domains, beginning with a systems model for the complete "creational" system that includes the physical, mental and spiritual universe. His cutting-edge research in quantum physics and mathematics pioneered the application of graph-theoretic systems modelling to quantum systems. He subsequently used this formalism to study quantum teleportation, and model the brain as a quantum Hopfield network, with particular emphasis on the role played by contextuality and qudits of odd-prime dimension d, with d tending to infinity.

All this happens with religious activites going on in parallel.
        -> The colony is laid out in an open garden setting, and nobody owns any property in Dayalbagh individually. The land, the houses, and institutions all belong to the community as a whole.
        -> The community has been involved in various initiatives, all aimed at sustainable development and self-sufficiency.
        -> Dayalbagh offers an excellent example of sustainable development of nature, man, and society, with a serene environment that has large area of farm lands, trees and plants everywhere and simple living that helps in reducing pollution and no carbon emmission.

        -> The ‘spirit of service to mankind’ is evident in all institutions of Dayalbagh including agroecological-cum-precision farming, education and healthcare and small-scale industries. Voluntary service in these institutions helps to keep the cost of producing the goods and services low.

  utter_satsang_in_dayalbagh:
    - text: |
        Satsang and meditation are part of the spritual life and these are part of the daily life of dayalbagh people:
        -> Satsang means association with Sat Purush, that is, the True Supreme Being. Therefore that congregation where a true Saint who is in communion with the Sat Purush i.e., the Supreme Being is present, and where true devotees, who perform spiritual practices with devotion and sincerity under His supervision, discuss and sing praises of the Supreme Being and expound the true path and the method of communion with Him, can rightly be called True Satsang. One cannot sufficiently describe the benefits of a such association.
        -> Construction of the Satsang Hall was started in 1917. The portion where the ladies sit was constructed first and then, in 1924, the Correspondence Hall was constructed.
        -> In the 1940s, during the time of Param Guru Huzur Mehtaji Maharaj, the Satsang Hall was extended. It was expanded again, with work starting in 2006. This design was an indigenous one that was vetted by experts from IIT Delhi and the project took about three years from drawing board to execution. The Satsang Hall is now 205 ft. long and 160 ft. wide.
        -> To the north of the Satsang Hall is an open extension with a large platform. Shuttered openings separate it from the main building. The open platform can be covered temporarily when required and has a seating capacity of 6000. After expansion, the seating capacity of the main Satsang Hall has increased to 8000 persons. The open platform of the Bhandara ground located further north of the Satsang Hall can accommodate about 10,000 persons.
        -> The Central Satsang at Dayalbagh is the nucleus of the spiritual and religious activities of the Ra Dha Sva Aa Mi Satsang movement, and Satsangi brothers from all parts of the country and abroad make it a point to come as often as possible to attend the meetings for the divine service held at the Central Satsang.
        -> The meetings are held every morning and evening under the spiritual leadership of the Sant Satguru of the time, in which all pilgrims and residents of Dayalbagh join. After an initial period of abhyas (devotional practice), the service commences with the congregation reciting a prayer (manglacharan), containing a grateful expression of the immense spiritual benefit conferred upon mankind by the Gracious Supreme Creator in creating the true path of salvation and the gracious assistance which He accords to devotees in their spiritual journey.
        -> After this, pieces are read from the compositions of the Revered Leaders, in both, prose and poetry. The service closes with another recitation (Binati) by the congregation (prayer) to the Gracious Supreme Being that assistance and grace may be extended to all His frail and forgetful children who can do nothing towards the attainment of true emancipation without His help.
        -> The place of Satsang (Holy Service) and the center of many activities in Dayalbagh is the simple yet majestic Satsang Hall which is located in the heart of the Colony.
        -> The Satsang Hall has a more efficient sound system, closed circuit TVs and projection screens for the convenience of the congregation now. At the time of the expansion of the Satsang Hall, a retiring room for Gracious Huzur was also constructed on the eastern side, where a radio room was located earlier.
        -> The meditational practice of uniting spirit current with sound current, known as "Surat-Shabda-Yog," is fundamental to the people of the Ra Dha Sva Aa Mi faith, which is practiced in Dayalbagh. These practices reflect the community's commitment to integrating spiritual development with daily life and service.
        -> Nowadays Satsang is happening at the fields during the fieldwork. Satsangies can take part in satsang with the field works.
        So satsang and meditation are part of the daily life of dayalbagh people.

        -> A modest operation commenced February 1918 with 3 cows and 1 bull at Mubarak Kuan (presently Ayurvedic Pharmacy) and Dairy Bagh. After some initial setbacks followed by intense research, an indigenous dairy was established in 1926 based on a Danish model. It had simple machinery, an automatic pasteurizing and bottling plant, 170 acres of pastureland and a herd of 120 heads of prized cattle including crossbred cows.
        -> The dairy was modernized subsequently with an imported pasteurization plant, automatic bottling unit, testing laboratory and other equipment from America, and Denmark.

Pasteurized milk, Cupid Butter and Ghee from Dayalbagh were well known in the entire city of Agra, its suburbs and Mathura. Cupid butter was sent to USA in 1934 for some quality testing on a sea journey of 45 days without refrigeration. It scored 91 marks as against 92 scored by an American brand.
